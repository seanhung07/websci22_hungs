Stack: 

Backend: Nodejs \
Frontend: Angular/Material-UI \
Graph: D3.js
Database: MongoDB

How to start the project:

go to backend folder and run node server.js and you can check the website on http://localhost:3000


In Lab8 I complete all my functionally, if I want to trade with those data, I can't keep all the data since the past data will affect recent data. Therefore, I add a button called clear data, it will clear all the document in the collection. To add the data you can press get data to get the latest data. Additionally, I change the edit functionally. the user can only change the text, when they add or update the data manually the backend will recalculate the sentiment data. Finally, I add a toggle button to let the user choose if they want to show the D3 graph. I still didn't found a way to generate the word cloud in angular. If I want to continue work with this project I would probably change backend to python to implement machine learning to calculate the sentiment data more accurate.
