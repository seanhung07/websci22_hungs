Stack: 

Backend: Nodejs \
Frontend: Angular/Material-UI \
Graph: D3.js
Database: MongoDB

How to start the project:

go to backend folder and run node server.js and you can check the website on http://localhost:3000


In Lab8, I complete all my functions, and if I want to trade with those data, I can't keep all the data since the past data will affect recent data. Therefore, I added a button called clear data. It will clear all the documents in the collection. You can press get data to get the latest data to add the data. Additionally, I change the edit functionally, both frontend and backend. The user can only change the text. When they add or update the data manually, the backend will recalculate the sentiment data. Finally, I added a toggle button to let the user choose if they want to show the D3 graph. I still didn't found a way to generate the word cloud in angular. If I want to continue working on this project, I would probably change the backend to python to implement machine learning to calculate the sentiment data more accurately.
