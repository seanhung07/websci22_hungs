In the quiz you can get all the item in the api by typing /mongo. This time i choose to select the stock (Twitter and Reddit )data on the Kaggle and random select 500 post, you can find the document in q.json and parseq.json. i do a etl to let the data sucessfully upload. For d3 i choose pie chart and bar char to anaylze stock and crypto market sentiment. I didn't have chance to make the kaggle data auto go into database so I upload parseq.json manually. We can see right now the market is kind of netural.
