The Weather app is designed to be easy to use and search for current weather data for various countries and US states. When you get into the page the website will ask for your geolocation access (click allow!) it will shows up your current location weather data. In this weather app, I add a autocomplete functionality that includes 220 countries and all the states in the US. Additionally, I add the animation, when you move your mouse pointer on the cards it will hover. The backgroud image is come from unsplash (free high quility image background). They had provided the [unsplah api documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation#getting-started), you will need ti request a apikey, however you can also access the picture through this [link](https://source.unsplash.com/random/?weather).I originally planned to use the API, but the disadvantage of the API is that it can only make 50 requests per hour, which is not convenient for development, so I choose to download the images.
